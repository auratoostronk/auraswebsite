		<p>Hi! I'm aura! I'm a 20 year old college student studying
		programming. My goal is to become a Game Designer, so I spend
		much of my free time working on cool programs and video game mods.
		This is my website where I host my amazing programming
		and modding projects! Go ahead and poke around! I'm sure
		you'll find something you'll like! Do note that the big files
		needed to be hosted externally to Dropbox.</p>

		<h2>ALPHATIUS</h2>
		<br><h3>A deathmatch mod for DOOM II:</h3>

		</h4>
		<br>
		<p>This mod started out as a neat idea inspired by Seidolon's DOOM ULTIMATE LASER ARENA,
		or "DULA" for short. Contrary to the chaotic atmosphere of DULA, ALPHATIUS was designed
		with balance in mind, while also keeping the fun, fast-paced and action-packed gameplay of
		DULA and DOOM II. Currently there are 6 different weapons with two fire modes each,
		6 exclusive maps, 4 travel abilities that allow the player to maneuver around terrain,
		and multiple weapon mods that alter the behavior of the weapons. These gameplay elements
		combine to make a deathmatch mod like no other! Requires Zandronum.</p>

		<h2>AURA'S INSTAGIB CHAOS</h2>
		<br><h3>All it takes is one hit!</h3>

		<br>
		<p>Ever wondered what Deathmatch would be if every weapon killed you in one hit? Insanely
		imbalanced, right? Well, what if we took that concept, and somehow made it fair? Presenting
		AURA'S INSTAGIB CHAOS! A mod where anything and everything can and will kill you if it hits
		you! One might say, "How can this be balanced at all?" To which I would respond, "If you
		think this mod uses hitscans, then you need to think a little harder." "Projectiles!" is
		your answer! Some are fast and short ranged, some are slow but travel indefinitely. Some
		even seek after enemies! Some take time to charge up! Overall, its a blast; something you
		need to see for yourself in action! Requires Zandronum.</p>

		<h2>GUITAR HERO HERO IN GUITAR HERO</h2>
		<br><h3>A song about Guitar Hero... in Guitar Hero!</h3>

		<p>Yo dawg I heard you like Guitar Hero. So we put a song about Guitar Hero in Guitar Hero
		so you can rock out to Guitar Hero while you play Guitar Hero. No, but seriously; if you haven't heard
		of MC Lars, he's a hip-hop artist that made a rock song about Guitar Hero called "Guitar Hero Hero". 
		So I charted the song (put the notes together for the song and all that) and put it into a Guitar Hero
		clone called Clone Hero, which lets you play just about any song on your PC, for FREE. You just need
		the chart for the song, which you can download HERE! Also, do check out the original song if you wish!

		<h2>BRADLEY'S MOD</h2>
		<br><h3>A parody of Minecraft mods as a Minecraft mod?</h3>

		<br>
		</h4>
		<p>This mod is a joke mod for minecraft. The story behind it involves a fat minecraft
		addict named Bradley who wanted to make a mod but didn't know how to code, so he 
		hired someone to code the mod for him. However, since Bradley is an imbecile, his mod
		consists of terrible gameplay and bland concepts. The mod parodies
		other minecraft mods with unoriginal ideas (i.e. the classic "obsidian tools"), while being
		intentionally terrible at the same time, but somehow manages to be crazy and 
		funny at the same time! Requires Minecraft Forge 1.12.2

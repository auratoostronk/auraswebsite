		<h3>ALPHATIUS
		<br>A deathmatch mod for DOOM II:</h3>

		<br>
		<p>This mod started out as a neat idea inspired by Seidolon's DOOM ULTIMATE LASER ARENA,
		or "DULA" for short. Contrary to the chaotic atmosphere of DULA, ALPHATIUS was designed
		with balance in mind, while also keeping the fun, fast-paced and action-packed gameplay of
		DULA and DOOM II. Currently there are 6 different weapons with two fire modes each,
		6 exclusive maps, 4 travel abilities that allow the player to maneuver around terrain,
		and multiple weapon mods that alter the behavior of the weapons. These gameplay elements
		combine to make a deathmatch mod like no other!</p>

		<h3>AURA'S INSTAGIB CHAOS
		<br>Another deathmatch mod for DOOM II:</h3>

		<br>
		<p>Ever wondered what Deathmatch would be if every weapon killed you in one hit? Insanely
		imbalanced, right? Well, what if we took that concept, and somehow made it fair? Presenting
		AURA'S INSTAGIB CHAOS! A mod where anything and everything can and will kill you if it hits
		you! One might say, "How can this be balanced at all?" To which I would respond, "If you
		think this mod uses hitscans, then you need to think a little harder." "Projectiles!" is
		your answer! Some are fast and short ranged, some are slow but travel indefinitely. Some
		even seek after enemies! Some take time to charge up! Overall, its a blast; something you
		need to see for yourself in action!</p>

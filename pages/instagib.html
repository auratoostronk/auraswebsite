		<h3>All it takes is one hit!</h3>
		<p>Ever wondered what Deathmatch would be if every weapon killed you in one hit? Insanely
		imbalanced, right? Well, what if we took that concept, and somehow made it fair? Presenting
		AURA'S INSTAGIB CHAOS! A mod where anything and everything can and will kill you if it hits
		you! One might say, "How can this be balanced at all?" To which I would respond, "If you
		think this mod uses hitscans, then you need to think a little harder." "Projectiles!" is
		your answer! Some are fast and short ranged, some are slow but travel indefinitely. Some
		even seek after enemies! Some take time to charge up! Overall, its a blast; something you
		need to see for yourself in action! Requires Zandronum.</p>

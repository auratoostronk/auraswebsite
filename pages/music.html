                <h2>Onslaught</h2>
                <p>"Onslaught" was a track made by myself and my cousin while we were on a family vacation. I came up with a very simple guitar riff but it didn't
                exactly fit the time signature, so my cousin took it, added some chugs to it, and with some bass, synth, other riffs and a drum beat it eventually 
                became "Onslaught".</p>
                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                <p>I brought my child-sized Fender Squier that I grew up with because I liked the pickups in it. I also used a BOSS Metal Zone MT-2 for the distortion,
                and directly plugged it into my Scarlet Solo audio interface. Everything else was done in Ableton Live 11.</p>

                <h2>Arms Race</h2>
                <p>"Arms Race" was written shortly after Onslaught. I used similar tools as Onslaught, the Boss Metal Zone pedal, the Scarlett audio interface, and Ableton. However, 
                I learned about dual-tracking shortly after making Onslaught so I did that to the guitars to make it sound fuller.</p>

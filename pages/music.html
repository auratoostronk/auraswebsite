            <section class="left">
                <p>"Onslaught" was a track made by myself and my cousin while we were on a family vacation. I came up with a very simple guitar riff but it didn't
                exactly fit the time signature, so my cousin took it, added some chugs to it, and with some bass, synth, other riffs and a drum beat it eventually 
                became "Onslaught". I used my child-sized Fender Squier that I grew up with because I liked the pickups in it. I also used a BOSS Metal Zone MT-2 for the distortion,
                and directly plugged it into my Scarlet Solo audio interface. Everything else was done in Ableton Live 11.</p>

            <section class="left">
                <p>"Arms Race" was written shortly after Onslaught. I used similar tools as Onslaught; the Boss Metal Zone pedal, the Scarlett audio interface, and Ableton. However, 
                I learned about dual-tracking shortly after making Onslaught so I did that to the guitars to make them sound fuller. Fun fact about the main guitar riff: The first chord in the progression
                was actually supposed to be the last one; however, I ended up keeping it the way it came out because I thought it sounded better.</p>

            <section class="left">
                <p>"Another" was a pop punk song that I wrote for a final project at school. While there's no vocals for the song yet, I have lyrics written, and a vocal melody mapped out in a work-in-progress version of the song. I plan on finishing the song soon!</p>

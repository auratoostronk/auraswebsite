		<p>This mod started out as a neat idea inspired by Seidolon's DOOM ULTIMATE LASER ARENA,
		or "DULA" for short. Contrary to the chaotic atmosphere of DULA, ALPHATIUS was designed
		with balance in mind, while also keeping the fun, fast-paced and action-packed gameplay of
		DULA and DOOM II. Currently there are 6 different weapons with two fire modes each,
		6 exclusive maps, 4 travel abilities that allow the player to maneuver around terrain,
		and multiple weapon mods that alter the behavior of the weapons. These gameplay elements
		combine to make a deathmatch mod like no other!</p>

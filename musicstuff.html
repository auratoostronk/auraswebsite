		<h2>MUSIC STUFF</h2>
		<p>These are some of the beats I've assembled since I got my hands on Ableton.
		I have a lot more that are unfinished, need lyrics, sound like crap and need work,
		or any combination of these three, so I've put only my personal best as of now, on
		this website.</p>
		
		<h3>LIES SONG INSTRUMENTAL</h3>
		<h4><audio controls>
			<source src="files/liessong.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
			Your browser doesn't support this audio element!
		</audio></h4>
		<p>Based on Spose's "Lies Song feat. Wax & Shane Reis" from the album "Why am I so Happy?"
		See the original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6_ekdriutk" target="_blank">here</a>.
		It's pretty funny and worth a watch.</p>
		
		<h3>SEWERS</h3>
		<h4><audio controls>
			<source src="files/sewers.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

		</audio></h4>
		<p>This song was one of the first songs I put together. I decided to use it in my
		DOOM II Deathmatch Mod ALPHATIUS as the music for the fifth map "Waste".</p>
		
		<h3>THAT WAS EASY</h3>
		<h4><audio controls>
			<source src="files/thatwaseasy.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
			Your browser doesn't support this audio element!
		</audio></h4>
		<p>I managed to throw this song together pretty quickly, hence the name.
		I don't have much else to say about it, except I may add lyrics to it at
		some point.</p>
